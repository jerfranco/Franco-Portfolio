# Jeremiah Franco — Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background in web development. Built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase**, it features a modern, responsive layout with smooth scroll-based animations for an engaging user experience.

The site begins with a bold introduction — *"Hi, I'm Jeremiah! Turning Ideas into Websites, Systems, and Solutions"* — accompanied by quick-access buttons to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and a contact form.  

The **Projects** section highlights several key works completed during my time at Brigham Young University–Idaho in 2025, including:
- **REC Services**
- **Movie Web Finder**
- **Scholar Manager**
- **Class Roulette**
- **Network Design II**

The **Contact** section provides a simple form for visitors to reach out, with data securely stored using Supabase.

This portfolio serves as both a personal brand statement and a hub for my professional work, combining functionality, clean design, and a focus on user engagement.
